# The Oathless God

The Oathbreakers follow a single god, denying the Doros pantheon and all that is Yellith. Their gods name is **Azellius**, a god of blood and bone. They believe deeply in demons, monsters of the night, and soulless creatures that lurk through ethereal planes. Azellius is the binder of minds and worlds, a traveler there to protect them from the night.

Ancient Yellith texts sometimes refer to Azellius as a demi-god, leading some theologians to believe the Oathless God comes from the Doros pantheon, originating in a splintering that may have happened over two thousand years ago.
