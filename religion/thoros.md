# The Pantheon of Thoros

The pantheon described below predated the rise of the Yellithian empire, but was primarily spread when they came easterward from whatever distant shores they first left. Not much is known about the source of the gods of Doros, as few stories survived, but are mostly cult-related. A few small sub-sects have emerged with time, including individual household traditions, and the usual blending of cultures has occurred (creating unique interpretations based on geographic regions).

*Hythem* is a rare language associated with the highest priests and most sacred of texts. This is, directly, the language of the gods. They speak *Hythem*. Uttering the language of the gods as an unclean, unelevated is blasphemy met with death.
