## General Thoughts & Notes

### Magic

Magic in Earauth is a rare and beautiful thing not to be taken lightly. As such, consider the implications of being a spell caster. Think of Gandalf in Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit. How great does Gandalf let the world believe he is? Do the Hobbits of the Shire view him as the demi-god he is? He mostly an oddity, an individual with peculiar business puffing smoke and lighting fireworks, someone just odd enough to be a little frightening.

### Language

- Common (language), which every character gets, is Common Yellithian.
