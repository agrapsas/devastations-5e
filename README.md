# Earauth Dungeons & Dragons Campaign Setting

Earauth is a dark and dangerous place full of death, misery, and oppression. Life is fragile and unfair and the inhabitants of these lands have witnessed countless atrocities and felt the sting of a whip enough times to know better than to rebel, resist, or make the wrong kind of eye contact.

War rages seasonally across the beleaguered countryside as families, countries, and cultures battle over resources spread across the globe. The people are dragged into endless conflict.

This is not a place for heroes. Those that would stand up, be heard, and resist are immediately branded as enemies and meet gruesome ends.

This is a bleak world, a world of malice and revenge, this is Earauth.

## General Thoughts & Notes

### Magic

Magic in Earauth is a rare and beautiful thing not to be taken lightly. As such, consider the implications of being a spell caster. Think of Gandalf in Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit. How great does Gandalf let the world believe he is? Do the Hobbits of the Shire view him as the demi-god he is? He mostly an oddity, an individual with peculiar business puffing smoke and lighting fireworks, someone just odd enough to be a little frightening.

### Language

- Common (language), which every character gets, is Common Yellithian.
