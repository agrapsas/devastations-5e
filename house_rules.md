# House Rules

This document contains information about custom rules used in *A.A. Grapsas's the Devastations*, a 5E D&D experience.

## Classes

### Bard

#### Bardic Knowledge

Starting at first level, a bard may make a *bardic knowledge* check by using double their proficiency modifier on a *History (INT)* check when the DM calls for such a check.

## Combat

### Grappling

#### Engaging in Grapple (Bonus)

Anyone may use a *bonus action* to make an opposed grapple check.

- You make a Strength (Athletics) *OR Dexterity (Acrobatics)* check against your opponent's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) roll.
- On a successful attempt, your opponent cannot move (movement 0) and is grappled (condition grappled).
- *Your movement is also 0*.

#### Take Down (Action)

- As an action, you may attempt to trip or throw your opponent. 
- Make another grapple check. If you succeed, you bring the fight to the ground.
- On a critical success, you Ippon and your opponent is immediately restrained.
- On a critical failure, your takedown is reversed.

#### Restraining (Action)

- Once an opponent is grappled, you may attempt to restrain them by making an additional opposed grapple check.
- On a success, your opponent is condition restrained.

#### Moving While Grappled (Bonus)

- As a bonus action, you may attempt to move someone you are grappling by making opposed Strength (Athletics) checks.
- On success, you may move your opponent (and yourself) up to half your movement (this uses up your movement for that round).

## Criticals

### Success (natural 20)

- A natural 20 on a skill check allows double proficiency (or double ability modifier, whichever is higher).
- A natural 20 on an ability check allows double the ability modifier (e.g., an INT check with +3 becomes a +6).
- A natural 20 on an attack is double dice for damage (standard rules).

### Failure (natural 1)

- A natural 1 is an immediate failure.

The exact repercussions to rolling a natural 1 are situational. Some examples include:

- If the natural 1 is on a reflex save for damage, you take double damage.
- If the natural 1 is on an ability or skill check, you may make a wrong assumption or have a failed outcome that prevents retrying the action.

Natural 1's on attacks have special consequences:

- If the natural 1 is on an attack, roll a d20 with no modifiers.
- DC 5 check, if you fail, the DM will define a critical attack failure.
- Passing the DC 5 check (5 or higher) results in just a failed attack (no negative outcomes).
- If a 1 is rolled for the DC 5 check, roll another d20 (three 1's in a row causes immediate and severe self harm resulting in the character losing all hit points, becoming unconscious, and being in danger of dying).
