The most ancient home of the eldest kingdom of dwarves remaining on Earauth is not what it once was. The dwarves are no longer free masters of their own mines, owing more to the Yellith empire than the mountains themselves may be worth. Every dwarf is raised into backbreaking labor within the spiked stone buttresses of the mountain, working to pay off the debts of their fathers.

The dwarves produce weapons, equipment, and machinery to fuel the unending war that rages across the lands. Too often, ironclad younger and elder dwarves find themselves signing on to fight in the wars themselves, serving as mercenaries in the Yellithian army.

Settled nearby is the wealthy city of humankind Ardentia, a more recent construct mingling extreme wealth with deep poverty. The city taxes the exports and imports in the region, surrounded by a massive stone wall meant to prevent tax evaders from escaping than protecting the city. The dwarves find themselves paying high prices for equipment and materials they need, but pay the price regardless to make ends meet, locked in an unending cycle of servitude.

The Ardentians themselves were farmers and flock herders living in the shadow of the mountain before the Yellithian army overtook the sons of Cairnduhn. Little love exists between the two races anymore.
