The Yellith Empire spans many countries, mountain ranges, and across vast oceans, powered by a central, dominant religion, ruled by a ruthless array of military families and one, all powerful emperor.

Yella proper, the home of the Yellith, is actually not the ancestral place of these people. They arrived in modern day Yella hundreds of years ago and immediately subjugated the local Hakkonin people, forcing them to become servants and slaves to the highly militant and zealously religious Yellith people.

There are far fewer Yellith than those ruled by their vast privately funded armies. Every noble family has their own private army fed by the spoils of war. Whereas in the past the Yellith families warred heavily amongst themselves, decades of stability have seen the Yellithian families expand outward, conquering distant lands and vastly improving family (and imperial) holdings.

The Hakkonin people are responsible for much of the day-to-day of the empire, picking fruit, hunting, and raising livestock to feed the military engine of the Yellith people.

By far the strongest characteristic of the Yellithians is their ability to deeply understand the economic incentive and cost of warfare, calculating every single engagement down to the copper in expenditures, fees, costs, and (above all else) profits.

Yellin youths are trained both in the ways of physical conflict and the deep mathematical and operational models of conducting warfare. It is the rare Yellithian that does not participate in the warmachine, whether as a commander of men, a regular in an elite unit, or in logistics and planning.
