# Tukskomon

Magic is an elusive and fickle lover. No one really recalls the founding of the College of Hidden Letters in Tukskomon (though plenty of individuals and organizations claim credit). Perhaps the College has always been there, nestled within the sprawling city of Skaldenar? Perhaps the school existed beyond the time of men. No one knows. Plenty of scholars have attempted to expand on the already expansive history of the school, surrounding city, and the region proper; but, it just appears to have always existed.

**Languages:** Tukso, Kutso, Uksmo

**People Referred to as:** Tuks (colloquial), Kuts (colloquial), Uks (colloquial), Tuksomon (formal), Kutsomon (formal), Uksmomon (formal)

**Government Type:** Tribal council

**“Power” Type:** Regional

These misty highlands are painted with deep, rich forests older than any known on Earauth and white capped mountains higher than any others discovered. It is here that the University of Tukskomon (The College of Hidden Letters), older than the three tribes (though they would not agree) that now share power in the region, exists, built on a rocky slope spilling into dense, dark trees that sway and creep with magical energies.

## Cities/Areas

### Skaldenar

**Known As:** Skaldenar, Skald, Old Skald, City of Twilight, The Ethereal City

**People Referred to as:** Skaldens

**Government Type:** Mayoral (but, let’s face it, the school runs the show)

**Population:** 5,000 (Small City)

Skaldenar is known as the City of Twilight, as days in the ethereal city are always short and nights long. It is said that this was intended by the founders of the College, though who they were or why they would do such a thing is unknown. The darkness does lend itself to the arts, or so say the initiates in the School of Hidden Letters. Travelers might be passing through the lands during midday only find dusk upon them as they enter the boundaries (unwalled, as no one would dare cross the mages of the school).

The city itself is sprawled, having grown like a fungus from the walls of the school grounds.

### The School of Hidden Letters (University of Tukskomon)

**Known As:** The School of Hidden Letters (locally), University of Tukskomon (formally)

**Students Referred to As:** Wizards, magicians, etc.

**Government Type:** Dean, Board of Governors

**Population:** 120 students (initiates), 40 graduates (acolytes), 10 post graduate (fellows), 20 professors (various), assistant dean, dean

The university is a common place for all to study what magic still remains on Earauth, harnessing the creative forces of the universe. Through common decree, the region stays neutral in all conflicts and all powers agree to keep their soldiers, militaries, and economic business away from the land -- allowing the Tuks, Kuts, and Uks to live as they have for centuries (independent and one with the land their nomadic families cultivated as their primary range).

Entry into the university has a steep cost, and patrons often only sent the best, brightest (and most well connected) pupils to study. The rare gifted student has an opportunity to be awarded the single tuition free slot the university allocated annually, but must continue to prove themselves academically with every renewed semester or forfeit their spot.

### Et'temon

**Known As:** East Temon, The Hole (referring to mines), Trouble (by students)

**People Referred to As:** Temons

**Government Type:** Tribal council

**People Referred to As:** The Free Folk (self), The Free Fey, Wild Elves (vulgar)
