# Krateo

**Languages:** Krateia

**People Referred to as:** Krateians (to themselves), Saltlings (derogatory), Salt Lords (colloquial)

**Known As:** The Salt Kingdom, The Salt Reaches, The Salt Isles, The Salt Islands

**Government Type:** Monarchy, council of landowners

**“Power” Type:** Thalassocracy (sea power, an empire at sea, a seaborne empire)

At the heart of the seaborne empire of the Salt Islands is a deep, vast network of salt, copper, iron, and silver mines used extensively for trade. The salt lords are fiercely independent and allow few outsiders onto their islands. They have battled their neighbors for years, slowly conquering their islands until they have gained a massive command of the oceans in their region of the world.

With a vast array of precious resources to trade, salt lords can be found in nearly every port on Earauth, bringing wealth and prestige to the geographically small land they own. The amount of power wielded by the empire far exceeds the acres of islands they command.

No navy can stand tip-to-toe with the salt lords and they are masterful riders with fearless mounts equally at home on the deck of a ship as the mountainous expanses of their island network.
