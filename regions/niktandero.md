The Oathbreakers are (currently) the main enemy of the Yellith. They represent a collection of tribes with common religion, various offshoots of a common language, and a shared desire to ferociously protect what is theirs. They occupy a land considered sacred by many of the religions of Earauth, known as Nik’tandero in their language.

With recent discoveries of ancient cities and texts, the Yellith believe the root of their religion stems from primal temples in Nik’tandero (or Thoros, as they refer to it). The major Yellithian families all have strong holdfasts in Thoros and the Yellith empire controls the geographically important central city of Olderos (Kitch’haktero in Niktix), mainly populated by tribes of the area.

With the Yellith invasion, the many tribes of the region found common cause to band together in war against their enemy. The result is a constant, seasonal battle that rages in the warmer months -- as the region is a fairly cold climate.

The Yellith religion claims the region (known as the site of the pantheon’s power) is not just crucial to the creation myths found in their religion, but will be the place where the final battle of the end times will occur.

The tribes of the region have a similar tale, with an invasion of “other worlders” as the catalyst for the events that lead to the end of days -- they see this as a holy war against the destruction of Earauth by the Yellith peoples.
