# Player Races

This is a list of all races that players can use in Earauth. If a race is not listed here, playing the race is at the DM's discretion.

## Common Races

### Humans

Humans make up the largest population on Earauth. They have dominated the world through their sheer numbers and might. As such, most areas of the world are inhabited by humans.

### Elves

There once were grand elvish empires. They are a thing of the past. Only remnants remain in far off hidden lands, carefully guarded by dwindling populations.

Elves are common anywhere wealth exists. They live to serve -- literally. The Yellith Empire and other peoples maintain working populations of elves as skilled slaves. These slaves often become trusted companions of the family and are passed down from generation to generation as a token of recognition.

All elves have masters, but they have been so dominated that it's common to see an elf alone, performing the duties of their lord.

#### Free Elves

They exist. They are extremely rare. Players that wish to play a "free" elf and still participate in society are encouraged to "dock" their ears (cutting the tips to more correctly match a human's).

#### Escaped Elves

An escaped elf is hunting relentlessly and killed on sight. There is no room for disobedience in the Yellith Empire.

### Dwarves
