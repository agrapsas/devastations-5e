# Player Races

This is a list of all races that players can use in Earauth. If a race is not listed here, playing the race is at the DM's discretion.

## Common Races

### Humans

Humans make up the largest population on Earauth. They have dominated the world through their sheer numbers and might. As such, most areas of the world are inhabited by humans.

### Elves

There once were grand elvish empires. They are a thing of the past. Only remnants remain in far off hidden lands, carefully guarded by dwindling populations.

Elves are common anywhere wealth exists. They live to serve -- literally. The Yellith Empire and other peoples maintain working populations of elves as skilled slaves. These slaves often become trusted companions of the family and are passed down from generation to generation as a token of recognition.

All elves have masters, but they have been so dominated that it's common to see an elf alone, performing the duties of their lord.

#### Slaves

If you wish to play the elf slave of a lord, choose your lord, your purpose for being outside of the household, and what value you add to the lord's holdings.

#### Free Elves

They exist. They are extremely rare. Players that wish to play a "free" elf and still participate in society are encouraged to "dock" their ears (cutting the tips to more correctly match a human's).

#### Escaped Elves

An escaped elf is hunting relentlessly and killed on sight. There is no room for disobedience in the Yellith Empire.

### Dwarves

Dwarves are free and live in strongholds set in the sides of mountains; but, freedom comes at a cost. All dwarven populations owe fielty to the Yellith Empire and must allow their young men to be conscripted for war (usually as skilled labor). After a tour of duty, dwarves are allowed back to their communities to do what they do best: produce the much needed arms, armor, and items required by the Yellith war machine.

While dwarves are not slaves, their ancestral activities are restricted:

- No long, braided beards (these are seen as a symbol of war).
- No wearing armor in cities.
- No carrying weapons in cities.
- No wearing of clan colors.

#### Rebellion

Occasionally, dwarves have rebelled against the restrictions put in place by the Yellith Empire. Among these rebellious communities, the Yellith have instituted a policy of first born sons being "donated" to the Empire for its needs. These dwarven boys are kept clean shaven, taught only of the Yellith Empire, castrated so they may have no children, and trained as advanced shock troopers.

Every dwarven community knows that rebellion means facing their own blood.

## Less Common Races

### Half-Elves

Almost all half-elves are killed at birth. How do you create a half-elf? Well, a master must reproduce with a slave. While interactions between slaver and slave are expected, the inevitable outcome is an embarrassment to any respected house.

The occasional elvish parent or human lord may spare the child; but, this type of compassion is rare in the Yellith Empire.

#### Playing a Half-Elf

How have you come to be? What do you do to conceal your ears (less pronounced than an elf, but still very visible -- are they docked?).

#### A Captured Half-Elf

Any half-elf found is killed or brought before a lord for judgement (which will involve painful execution). Any lord found to have fostered and cared for a half-elf can expect equal treatment from their fellow lords.

### Halflings

They live in hills and forests, keeping away from the violence of the world. Many exude a level of innocence. Most humans would mistake a halfling for a child or perhaps a human with dwarfism.

### Gnomes

Almost extinct in the world, there are no communities of gnomes left. They tend to live in cities, trading their skills for a modicum of respect.
